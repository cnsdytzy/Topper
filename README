Topper - Infills for your 3D models
===========================


Getting Started
-------------------
Clone the repo, make a build and compile, like so:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake..
    >make;

After that you can run it like this:

    ./topper [input_model] [infill_number] [output_model]

Input models **must**  be in **.off** format, while output files can be in any format openscad supports (which are .stl / .off / .csg).

There are currently five infills, numbered below.

| Number | Infill Type                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ ---- |
| 0           |  Test                                                    |
| 1           |  Sphere Packing                                  |
| 2           |  Truncated Octohedron Tessellation   |
| 3           |  Rhombic Dodecahedron Tessellation |
| 4           |  Dynamic Struct to Vertex Support       |

Which look like this
